# Google Book Search

**Summary**

A web application that allows a user to search a comprehensive index of full text-books and receive relevant results based on a query.

**Tools and Technologies**
1. Google Book API
2. JQuery
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap 4.0
5. AJAX/JSON
6. Local Storage
7. HTML5
8. CSS3

## Challenges
1. Finding the appropriate tools and technologies to run my test cases.  So far I've tried: mocha and chai as well as karma, but I am still working on this.
2. For some reason, deploying to heroku proved to be relatively difficult compared to my past experiences. (several times I received errors regarding inability to parse the package.json)  
<strong> You can visit the application <a href="https://grandsuccess87.github.io/GoogleBookSearch/">here</a> on Github. </strong>
3. Maintaining content between web browser tabs for the user.  For now, I used local storage as a way to store data in the users' current browswer session.

## Notes
I had a lot of fun building this application and challenging myself in the process.  Although there is always room for improvement, I believe I was successful in retreiving the desired outcome and I feel great that I have learned so much throughout this process!
Thank You
