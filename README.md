# Google Book Search

##Summary

A web application that allows a user to search a comprehensive index of full text-books and receive relevant results based on a query.

##Tools and Technologies



##Challenges**
- Finding the appropriate tools and technologies to run my test cases
- For some reason, deploying to heroku proved to be relatively difficult compared to my past experiences. (several times I received errors regarding inability to parse the package.json)  
So the app is deployed <a href="https://grandsuccess87.github.io/GoogleBookSearch/">here</a> on Github.

##Notes
**I had a lot of fun building this application and challenging myself in the process.  Although there is always room for improvement, I believe I was successful in retreiving the desired outcome and I feel great that I have learned so much throughout this process!**
*Thank You*
